# Automatic Kahoot Client

This is a Python script that automatically answers multiple-choice questions on Kahoot.

## Description

This program uses Selenium and Chrome WebDriver to interact with a public Kahoot game. It scrapes the game's questions and answers, then automates a Kahoot client to answer the questions.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have installed the latest version of Python and pip.
* You have installed Selenium and Chrome WebDriver.

## Using Automatic Kahoot Client

To use check [releases](https://github.com/ncanora/Kahoot-Automation-Script/releases)

## Contributing to Automatic Kahoot Client

To contribute to Automatic Kahoot Client, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b <branch_name>`
3. Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m '<commit_message>'`
4. Push to the original branch: `git push origin <project_name>/<location>`
5. Create the pull request.

I consider this project, for all intents and purposes, finished. Because of the nature of webscraping tools, the program is fragile. Any change to the Kahoot website will break the program. However, if anyone would like to contribute, feel free! I will check pull requests.
